I really doubted posting this, but i need to defend myself against some serious allegations made by "cyber cohesion", im sorry if i offended anyone 

# introduction
Hey, today im gonna talk about the worst cybersec company ive ever interacted with, im gonna try to be baised as best as i could but if my feelings win, excuse me.
A QUICK NOTE TO THE READER : please do your own reasearch, im gonna provide proof to everything i say in this blog, but please do your own research, also sorry for if my english isn't correct ill try to correct it later

# The story
## Some background
It all starts with ensias ctf, cyber cohesion is a cybersec that made a deal with ensias school to make them a qualifiers for their yearly ctf which they call it MCSC.
I've played in MCSC for 3 years, it's been quite good not the best but quite acceptable for a national level, they where good until cybercohesion came in.
Back to the story, as i said cyber cohesion promised to make a good qualifiers "maybe even the ctf"  for them and they accepted (allegedly).

## MCSC qualifiers:
The qualifiers where in a broken plateform, it logs you off every 2 minutes, challenges are way too much guessy, they even sent the challenges sources in an email, CAN YOU IMAGINE ? AN EMAIL?????

![email](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234282281410101278/image.png?ex=66302a73&is=662ed8f3&hm=2ca87da23162ed20a422d0a518a13b830bd53b9598145a84e01dacf3e0891965&)

but we played and somehow qualified.

## MCSC chad move [finals]:
I really dont know what was the reason behind dumping cybercohesion midway (allegedly) but what a chad move, the finals were hosted on ctfd, quite a good ratio of challenges made by the students and somehow they were way much enjoyable than the qualifiers and we ranked the 1st place.

## AKASEC AND US
1337 [my school] played with multiple teams, we all know each other we laugh talk about ctfs play ctfs internationally, them guys have some good talents.
i hear you i hear you, you saying we're under one school we all wanna win and that can lead to flag sharing and stuff.
but no, we all agreed on one thing which is "may the best win", we exelled in categories that they didnt solve and they exelled in some that we didnt solve.
at the end the ranking was :
    ```
    1. our team
    2. 0xnox        [some club in fes]
    3. akasec       [under the same school]
    ```

## DRAMA
so there was a ceremonie at the end by MCSC staff where everything was satisfied also a bit tired, but not akasec leader [mza7a] the guy stood up and talked in stage when he had the chance of what he didnt like he talked about a lot of things including cybercohesion plateform and his experience with the ctf [it's all taped btw MCSC staff have all the fotage], ensias team took the L proudly tried to defend themselves but not cybercohesion they banned him by sending an email saying that he insulted the staff then the curse latched on our school.
Im gonna try and find a video where mza7a was talking to prove that he was just giving critisism.

## aisec international summit background [2023]
Okey so these guys ensa marrakesh, i cant stop talking shit about them, they organized a ctf before their collab with cybercohesion and it was so shit [unsolvable challenges, annoying staff talking about not opening discord, recycled challenges...]
i hated that ctf but it had some good parts, crypto and blockchain were so S tier and somehow i had a fun time making new connections

## ENSA marakesh collab [2024]
so it all started by the start of the qualifiers, we started playing just for fun, i literally solved 2 "PWN" challenges just by extracting the .ova files and submitting the flags then i slept.
When i woke up i was surprised that our team name wasnt even on the qualifiying list which made me ask on discord what was the reason of the disqualification
// TODO : add image
Staff said it was an anti-cheat engine that detected anomalies in our time of submitting challenges was at the same time of multiple teams that where banned [most of them are 1337 which makes me really wonder ], so we asked for proof of cheating, everytime we asked for a proof of cheating they said that they reported it to the club.
It was a pain in the ass just trying to communicate with them, i just wanted some proof of cheating their answer was always either threathening by permenent disqualification, stalling or banning players that talk.

ill link the whole conversasion bellow until i quitted because i couldnt take it anymore.

After i quitted the server some mod name pasha started threatening to report me to the police and my school, even publicly shared my name in the discord server.

## highlights of the conversation

![start of the conversation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234221730785132624/image.png?ex=662ff20f&is=662ea08f&hm=f960d078778a6d54165dba5b5237aa4a3609799e3adf062ad10fcbecf8833e66&)

The author promised to show the proof, yet no proof has been shared

![staff stalling](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234221881847189656/image.png?ex=662ff233&is=662ea0b3&hm=42bf77a7b7cf804eeaec2377dccd5ef4aa2ecd8d43e54af900233c87f2d616bf&)

the staff here started stalling yet not sending real proof that we were cheating

![trying to talk them to send logs](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234221958351290418/image.png?ex=662ff245&is=662ea0c5&hm=4a315e763d543a3aeb09c54ec0c509a65d30e2760709c4868d06d181bf2c8b33&)

Well the staff presisted to not send any proof publicly

![still nicely asking for proof](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234222009055973519/image.png?ex=662ff251&is=662ea0d1&hm=8dd2744fbcf9bf99c7f5f114de804c9397308e2a0d9af4e268df888e7ea9b8eb&)

![staff started threathening by bannin players](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234222138416693379/image.png?ex=662ff270&is=662ea0f0&hm=1dfecd744d288ac0e4bb09236dadcda522ef8dae1b46972459e1ce9d89311ab6&)

Here staff started threathening players to be banned if they wanted to recieve proof which is actually insane

![sum up](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234230936262934651/image.png?ex=662ffaa2&is=662ea922&hm=98f8761cd754aafcf21fea8ed1d236095447dfa0371e2da0a0f5119c7e1ea6e2&)

quick sum up for all what happened

![no ret](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234279607859937410/IMG_7257.png?ex=663027f6&is=662ed676&hm=8d2c4c1780312180b4093f79c283d2fdc7fb68eb9965f3a442d8ee37a5066cc1&)

once i quitted the server the staff did an L move and shared my name publically which he extracted from the plateform, which is just outragous

![policy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1041206758187737108/1234265373243605124/rules.png?ex=66301ab4&is=662ec934&hm=3453eaecc48a8f1df91984e2bce42b4bc67c5d239026dcbaa7237d974413ad60&)

btw this is their rules they're not allowed to share your infos with third parties but they're allowed to dox you, fucking insane!!

this is a dump to the whole discord server, nothing is deleted

## end of story
Now in their defence truly ive created drama in the server, i couldnt shut the fuck up about the injustice of disqualifying us, now its left to you the reader to decide either im in the wrong or are they?
